== 📦 Overview

*Sputnik* is a portable ESP32-based IoT MCU designed for:

- Rapid prototyping of environmental data logging
- Seamless Wi-Fi management with captive fallback
- Posting 15-minute averaged temperature and humidity data to Google Sheets
- Cloud-based live monitoring via Arduino IoT Cloud

This branch adds a **WiFiManager Soft-AP fallback**: if saved Wi-Fi fails, it starts a configuration portal named `Sputnik-Setup` (`password: sputnik123`) for field deployment convenience.

== ⚙️ Key Features

- ✅ Auto-connect to saved Wi-Fi or launch Soft-AP setup
- 🌡️ Reads DHT21 (AM2301) sensor every minute
- 🧠 Buffers 15 readings and averages them
- ☁️ Sends JSON data to Google Apps Script every 15 minutes
- 🌍 Maintains live sync with Arduino IoT Cloud
- 🕒 NTP time sync to GMT+8

== 🔧 Board & Library Requirements

- Board: `ESP32` (via Espressif board manager)
- Libraries:
  - `WiFiManager` → https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager
  - `DHT sensor library` → https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library
  - `ArduinoIoTCloud` (auto-generated)
  - `HTTPClient` (built-in with ESP32 core)

== 🧪 Hardware Wiring

- DHT21 Data → GPIO 15
- VCC → 3.3V
- GND → GND

== 📤 Data Endpoint

POST data as JSON to Google Sheets via:
[source,json]
----
{
  "temperature": 29.00,
  "humidity": 59.40,
  "mcu": "sputnik1"
}
----

== 🗂️ Files
