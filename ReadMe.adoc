ðŸ“¡ Sputnik â€” ESP32U Portable MCU Kit
Sputnik is a compact, field-ready microcontroller unit built with the ESP32U (with external antenna), designed for rapid deployment, testing, and prototyping of IoT-based environmental monitoring applications. It is ideal for validating sketches, verifying cloud uplink/downlink functionality, and testing WiFi connectivity â€” all in a tidy, battery-powered form.

ðŸ§° Features
ESP32U microcontroller with external antenna (stronger signal gain)

LiPo battery powered with onboard USB charging module (TP4056)

OLED screen (I2C) for local display of system status or sensor data

DHT sensor (AM2301/DHT21) for humidity and temperature sensing

Power switch for easy on/off control

Modular extension capability for additional sensors or relays

Accessible USB port for firmware flashing or serial debugging

ðŸ§ª Use Cases
Upload and test Arduino sketches directly in the field

Verify WiFi accessibility and cloud dashboard (e.g., Arduino Cloud)

Test HTTP/HTTPS POST requests to Google Apps Script or APIs

Display live sensor values on OLED

Evaluate sensor performance over time

Train students or researchers on IoT data collection

ðŸ“¦ Included Modules
Component	Purpose
ESP32U Dev Board	Main MCU + WiFi + BLE
OLED Display	Visual feedback
DHT Sensor	Environmental sensing
TP4056 Module	Battery charging
